		<h1>Dance Dance Revolution</h1>
		<p> <img src="DanceDanceRevolution_White_Machine_with_DDR_A_installed.png" alt="A White Dance Dance Revolution A arcade machine, also known coloquially as &quot;White Cabs&quot;"/>  Dance Dance Revolution is a 4-panel arcade rhythm game released in 1998 in Japan and 1999 internationally. The game proved to be a massive hit, both in Japan and overseas in the United States, where it became a staple of arcades during the turn of the millenium. Several different arcade cabinets and home console releases hit the market, boasting licensed popular hits and original tunes made in-house. While arcades slowly faded away from the public eye and home consoles moved away from gimmicky games and peripherals, many dedicated enthusiasts continue playing the game and its imitators.</p>
		<p> Through the use of DIY homebrew set-ups and pads, emulation and open-source projects, many DDR players continue dancing on the dance floor in the comfort of their own home. However, there are still a subset of purists who still seek out the original arcade cabinets wherever they may be,<img src="Girl_playing_Legacy_Dance_dance_revolution_cabinet.jpg" alt="A girl playing Dance Dance Revlolution." id="girl"/> remnants of a bygone era. Although DDR and arcades as a whole have fallen out of the public conscience, they haven't gone away completely. New releases of Dance Dance Revolution can still be seen in the wild, with exclusive cabinets in Round1 and Dave &amp; Busters in the United States, as well as continued support in Japan, with people of all ages joining in on the fun and tournaments still being held to this day. As rhythm games come and go, nothing can compete with the unique flavor and cultural impact of Dance Dance Revolution.
